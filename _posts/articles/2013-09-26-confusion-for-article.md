## Confusion of article's place

I used _github page_ to write articles ever. However, then, I changed to build a website in myself to do the job. Bcs, I want to edit article online.

But now, [prose.io](http://prose.io) get the work. What the hell of the work! My website do not have its value. What's going on?
